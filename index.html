          engineer College, Østfold nursing college, Østfold social work college

          Great colleagues

          Harald Borgebund is a professor at HiØ. He works as an associate
          professor in political science. -I work as a lecturer for the bachelor
          study in international communication, while also working with
          research. Recently, he published an article about the relationship
          between libertarianism and the welfare state. What do you think about
          HiØ as a workplace? - The best about HiØ is the great colleagues.
          Also, I think Halden is such a great place to be! Mr Borgebund also
          mentions he produces a podcast together with Sondre Lindahl about
          political science.

            According to the Great Norwegian Encyclopedia, from the summer of
            1994, the Norwegian university college reform was completed. 98
            smaller colleges were merged into what became 26 larger colleges.
            The reform had a goal of creating new, strong and efficient colleges
            in all of Norway’s counties. For Østfold, this resulted in Østfold
            university college. The college based in Halden and Fredrikstad can
            offer a wide range of studies, all of which is divided into three
            faculties. The studies vary from associate degrees, all the way up
            to doctorates.
